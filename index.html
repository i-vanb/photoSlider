        <h2>Bosphorus</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Bosphorus. And today I want to share with you the most valuable
            thing that each of us has: namely, memories of beauty and dreams of even more magnificent.
            Agree, the most important souvenir that can be brought from somewhere far away is the
            memories of those wonderful moments that have left a bright mark on our memory. I also
            have such a souvenir for you: luxurious memories of Istanbul. I was there and I want to
            tell you: there is nothing more beautiful. I spent unforgettable days there. And this is
            what I remembered the most: this is the day when, waking up in the morning, I saw snow
            flying over the Bosphorus. There were only a few days before Christmas ... And also ...
            Stop. I'll tell you the rest when we meet. You will tell me about your unforgettable
            travels and wonderful memories. I'm sure you have them. Do you also believe in miracles?
            I believe. And I wish to meet you this Christmas. Because everyone needs their own bear.
            I am sure you and I will have even more wonderful memories and the very first and best of
            them is the meeting of Christmas.
            See you!
            Have a wonderful holiday and Merry ChristmasðŸŽ„ everyone !!!!
